==============

Proof of Concept of a dynamic pricing engine using JBoss Drools or Groovy

The idea is to provide a way the user by a external script language is 
able to modify the price evaluation for a product. The objective of this project is to check which language or approach 
is more "user-friendly", or in another words, which script language is better for a non-professional programmer.
